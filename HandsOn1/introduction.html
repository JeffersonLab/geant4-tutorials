<H1>Hands On 1: Setting Up the Environment</H1>

During the next days we will develop a Geant4 application that will use Geant4 libraries. <br/><br/>
Geant4 is a <i>toolkit</i>, thus a Geant4 installation consists of a set of library
and header files (plus resource files: the data-base data and
examples source code). <br/>
You create an application compiled and linked against a Geant4 installation.<br/>

<H2><a class="content" id=intro>Introduction</a></H2>
In this first hands on you will learn:
<ul>
	<li>How to install Geant4 and some of the most common configuration options (OPTIONAL)</li>
	<li>How to compile an application against an installed version of Geant4</li>
	<li>How to run an application and interact with Geant4.</li>
</ul>

There is no exercise tar-ball for this first hands on since we use Geant4 code base.
