<h2><a class="content" id=intro>Introduction</a></h2>

During the next days we will develop a Geant4 application that will use Geant4 libraries, version 11.2.0. <br/><br/>
Geant4 is a <i>toolkit</i>, thus a Geant4 installation consists of a set of library
and header files (plus resource files: the data-base data and
examples source code). <br/>
You create an application compiled and linked against a Geant4 installation.<br/>

<br/>
<hr/>

<h1>Hands On 1: Setting Up the Environment</h1>

In this first hands on you will learn:
<ul>
	<li>How to install Geant4 and some of the most common configuration options (OPTIONAL)</li>
	<li>How to compile an application against an installed version of Geant4</li>
	<li>How to run an application and interact with Geant4</li>
</ul>

There is no exercise tar-ball for this first hands on since we use Geant4 code base.<br/>
<br/><hr/><h2><a class="content" id=conv>Conventions</a></h2>

We are going to use Geant4 Version 11.2.0 (Geant4 version numbers
are expressed with the doublet or triplet of numbers: <i>Major.Minor</i>
or <i>Major.Minor.PatchLevel</i>).<br/><br/>

<b>All the Hands On instructions of this week, we will use the following conventions:</b>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>This font</code> represents shell input/output,
		C++ code or file names.
	</li>
	<li> The lines that start with the character <code>$</code> represents
		Linux shell commands that you have to type in while you are on the OS shell.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>&lt;tutorial&gt;</code> is the working directory.
		You must replace this string with the appropriate directory path in your disk space.
	</li>
	<li>
		Strings in parenthesis (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>)
		are optional.
	</li>
</ul>
<br/><hr/><h2><a class="content" id=g4inst>Geant4 Installation</a></h2>

Depending on your machine or your preference, follow one of the four installation procedures.

<ul>
	<li><a href="#g4SbyS">Step by step compilation</a></li>
	<li><a href="#g4D">Using Docker</a></li>

	<li><a href="#g4VM">Installing the CERN virtual machine</a></li>
</ul>
<br/><hr/><h3><a id=g4SbyS>Step-by-step Compilation</a></h3>

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

With its basic installation options Geant4 Version 11.2.0 does not
have external dependencies, but to configure the compilation and installation
process <a href="http://www.cmake.org">cmake</a> is needed.<br/>

The role of cmake is to automatically create
<i>Makfiles</i> (or project files for IDEs) based on
options that can be specified based on your own environments.<br/><br/>

We will show how to use cmake via command line options, but a
menu-based version of cmake exists (type <i>ccmake</i> instad of
<i>cmake</i>) and for some platforms also a GUI is available
(<i>cmake-gui</i>). Geant4 Version 11.2.0 requires cmake version at least 3.16.<br/>

Geant4 version 11.2.0 contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>
code, this mean that the compiler needs to support this standard.
With recent versions of Linux this is the default,
but you may need to manually install and setup a compiler in some cases.<br/>
Refer to the <a href="http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html">Geant4 installation guide</a>
for additional information, including the list of supported compilers.


<h4>Visualization and GUI</h4>

We will also describe how to
setup and use the interactive graphical user interface (GUI) based on
<a href="https://qt.io">Qt</a>.<br/>

We use Qt version 5.6.<br/>

Many Linux distributions already have a pre-installed version of Qt. It is relatively easy to
manually install Qt on a Linux or Mac system, but we will not cover
this step in this tutorial. <br/>

This component is optional, if you do not want to use Qt simply skip the Qt options during
configuration. <b>None of exercises require GUI interfaces to be completed.</b><br/><br/>

If you do not have Qt or do not want to use it, the examples in
this tutorial will fall back to simple OpenGL graphics. In such a case
to enable OpenGL graphics, use
<code>-DGEANT_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON</code> when configuring G4 with
<i>cmake</i>. <br/> While for Linux this should not be a problem, it could
have issues on Mac systems. If this fail, contact us.


<h4>Multi-threading</h4>
Starting with Geant4 Version 11 series, we introduced event level parallelism via
tasking mechanism. This means that we will develop a parallel application
that will simulate events using all available cores of your machine.<br/>

This is an optional component: we will show here how to turn it
on, but if you do not want to enable MT you can still follow the exercises
as they are, since the code is also compatible with the sequential
version of Geant4.<br/>


<h4>Step 0: Obtain the Geant4 code</h4>
After downloading and un-packing Geant4 tarball
(<code>geant4-v11.2.0.tar.gz</code>) in an empty working
directory, you also need to
create <i>build</i> and <i>install</i> directories where the compilation of Geant4 is
performed, and resulted Geant4 libraries and related scripts are installed, respectively: cmake uses <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/FAQ">out of source builds</a>.


<h4>Step 1: Configuration</h4>
In the following we assume you are using a Linux machine. For Mac users there
are little differences, except that you will rely on the system compiler (clang) and cannot set an
alternative compiler (in an easy way).<br/><br/>

Let's configure Geant4:<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt<br/>
	$ wget http://cern.ch/geant4-data/releases/geant4-v11.2.0.tar.gz<br/>
	$ tar zxpf geant4-v11.2.0.tar.gz<br/>
	$ mkdir build install<br/>
	$ ls<br/>
	build geant4-vgeant4-v11.2.0 geant4-v11.2.0.tar.gz install<br/>
	$ cd build<br/>
	$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
	-DGEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED=ON -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON
	-DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON ../geant4-v11.2.0<br/>
</codeblock>
<br/>
Note:
<ul>
	<li>If you do not have <i>wget</i> you may download the Geant4 tar ball from <a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch/support/download">Geant4 download page</a>.
		You may also download the source code from <a target="_new" href="https://gitlab.cern.ch/geant4/geant4/-/releases/v11.2.0">
			CERN GitLab</a> or <a target="_new" href="https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/releases">GitHub</a>.
	</li>
	<li>Instead of <i>cmake</i>, you may use <i>ccmake</i> to configure build options one by one.
	</li>
	<li>If you have an old version of Linux with a default compiler with a version &lt;4.8.2,
		type <code>gcc --version</code> to get the compiler version, you need to have installed
		an alternative more recent compiler. For example if you have a CentOS 6 or Scientific Linux 6
		distributions you need to manually install a recent compiler. After doing that you need
		to prepend to the <code>cmake</code> line: <code>CC=gcc CXX=g++</code> and make sure that
		gcc and g++ binaries are the correct one.<br/>
		Replace <code>gcc</code> and <code>g++</code> with your alternative compiler if you have one
		and you want to use it
		(e.g. <code>icc</code> and <code>icpc</code> for Intel C compiler).<br/>
	</li>
</ul>


If everything goes as expected <Code>cmake</code> will work
few seconds on the configuration. The last lines should read:<br/><br/>
<codeblock>
	-- Configuring done<br/>
	-- Generating done<br/>
	-- Build files have been written to: &lt;tutorial&gt/build<br/>
</codeblock><br/>


Additional notes:
<ul>
	<li> If you do not want to use Qt, remove the <code>-DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON</code> option. If you do not want
		multi-threaded support remove also the corresponding option.
	</li>
	<li> If you disable Qt it is recommended to leave OpenGL with:
		<code>-DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		With Mac OS X you need XQuartz to be properly installed to use OPENGL_X11 option.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you have installed Qt manually, and you are using Qt 5.6, you may need to
		add: <code>-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=&lt;where-qt-is-installed&gt;/5.6/gcc_64</code>
		to cmake options if Qt is not found (you may need to adjust the path).
	</li>
	<li>Refer to the <a href="http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/index.html">
		installation manual</a> for a complete list of installation options. There are many more options available.
	</li>
	<li>If you already have installed Geant4 databases somewhere in your
		system, you can avoid downloading automatically the library by adding
		<code>-DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR=<i>where-the-dbs-are</i></code>.
	</li>
	<li>If you receive an error about
		EXPAT libraries, you can disable them with <code>-DGEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_EXPAT=OFF</code>.
	</li>
	<li>If you want to use an already installed version of CLHEP,
		instead of using the Geant4 internal one, you can specify that via the option:
		<code>-DGEANT4_USE_SYSTEM_CLHEP=OFF</code>. You may need to specify
		where to find CLHEP (see installation manuals).
	</li>
	<li>If you want to use an IDE you can specify the
		option <code>-G&lt;ide-type-goes-here&gt;</code> (run cmake without options to see a list of
		supported IDEs on your system. For example
		<ul>
			<li>
				on Mac OS X with Xcode: <code>cmake -GXcode [...]</code></li>
			<li>forKDevelop3 support: <code>-GKDevelop3</code></li>
			<li>for Eclipse: <code>cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" [...]</code></li>
		</ul>
		In such a case instead
		of makefiles cmake will create project files for that IDE.
	</li>
</ul>


<h4>Step 2: Compilation</h4>
Compile Geant4, on a multi-core system with <i>N</i> cores you can
substantially speedup compilation.<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt;<br/>
	$ make -j <i>N</i> #or gmake -j <i>2</i><br/>
	$ make install<br/>
</codeblock>

<br/>
<b>Note</b>: If not sure how many cores you have use  N=2.<br/>
<b>Note</b>: you can have a verbose compilation (for example to see the exact
compilation options) using <code>make VERBOSE=1 -j <i>2</i></code>.<br/><br/>


After Geant4 has been compiled and installed the content of the
&lt;tutorial&gt;/install directory should contain the directories:
<codeblock>bin share include lib[64]</codeblock><br/>


The <code>include</code> directory contains a sub-directory
(<code>Geant4</code>) where all the <code>.hh</code> files are
located. The directory <code>lib[64]</code> contains all Geant4
libraries and a sub-directory: <code>Geant4-11.2.0</code>, this
contains cmake files specific to Geant4 (they are used to compile an
application via cmake that <i>uses</i> Geant4).<br/><br/>

<br/><hr/>
<h3><a class="content" id=g4DLI>Download pre-compiled libraries</a></h3>
You may download binary images of pre-compiled Geant4 libraries for selected combinations of OS and compiler.
<ul>
	<li><a target="_new" href="https://cern.ch/geant4-data/releases/lib4.11.2/Darwin-clang15.0.0-Sonoma.tar.gz">MacOS Sonoma, clang-15.0.0</a></li>
	<li><a target="_new" href="https://cern.ch/geant4-data/releases/lib4.11.2/Linux-g++11.3.1-Alma9.tar.gz">Linux Alma9, g++-11.3.1</a></li>
	<li> Windows 10, Visual Studio Code-17.7.6- <a target="_new" href="https://cern.ch/geant4-data/releases/lib4.11.2/WIN32-VC17.7.6-10.exe">.exe</a>
		or <a target="_new" href="https://cern.ch/geant4-data/releases/lib4.11.2/WIN32-VC17.7.6-10.zip">.zip</a></li>
</ul>
You also need to download necessary data files from <a target="_new" href="https://www.geant4.org/download/11.2.0.html">Geant4 download page</a>.
<br/>



<br/><hr/>
<h3><a class="content" id=g4D>Using Docker</a></h3>

<a href="https://docs.docker.com"> Docker </a> is a tool designed to make it easier to run applications by using containers.
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs,
such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.


Docker is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. You can find the installation instructions
for your OS <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">here</a>.<br/><br/>

We have a Docker image with Geant4 and all the necessary libraries installed.
You can pull the image from the Docker Hub by running the following command:<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ docker pull &lt;imagename&gt;
</codeblock>
<br/>
where <code>&lt;imagename&gt;</code> is the name of the image you want to pull:

<ul>
	<li>jeffersonlab/sim:11.2.0-fedora36</li>
	<li>jeffersonlab/sim:11.2.0-ubuntu22</li>
</ul>

Once the image is pulled, you can run it in batch mode or interactively.<br/><br/>

<h4> Batch Mode:</h4>
<codeblock>
	$ docker run -it &lt;imagename&gt;
</codeblock>

<h4> Interactively:</h4>





<br/><br/><br/><hr/><h3><a class="content" id=g4VM>Installing the CERN Virtual Machine</a></h3>

<b>Note for virtual machine users:</b> if you are using a VM,
even if you have a multi-core laptop it is possible that the
VM sees only one CPU core. <br/>
It is usually just a matter of VM
configuration to allow more than one CPU in the guest OS.<br/><br/>

The Geant4 Virtual Machine provides a recent version of the Geant4 source code,
examples and libraries; it includes a compiler and extra software such as
a large set of visualisation libraries and analysis tools.<br/>

It provides a fully working Geant4 system.<br/>
It avoids the effort to find and install the key pieces needed to create an installation on your own system,
which varies depending on the OS, its version and many other factors.<br/><br/>

The following information is a summary of the key steps. Further guidance can be found at
<a target="_new" href="https://geant4.cenbg.in2p3.fr/">the CENBG home</a> of the Geant4 Virtual Machine.


<h4>Step 1: Ensure that your machine can run the Geant4 Virtual Machine</h4>
Make sure that your computer meets the minimum requirements:
<ul>
	<li>Windows or Linux users : desktop or laptop PC running Windows (preferably 10)</li>
	<li>Linux: desktop or laptop PC with a recent Linux release (able to run
		<a target="_new" href="https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMware workstation for Linux</a>)
	<li>Mac users : Mac with a recent version of macOS (capable of running the virtualization software below)
	</li>
	<li>at least 30 GB of free disk space available</li>
	<li>at least 4 GB of RAM available for the virtual machine on the PC or Mac - so likely a total of at least 6 or 8 GB installed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Obtain a Virtual Machine 'player'</h4>
There is a choice of Virtual machine host software. The following is what we recommend:
<ul>
	<li>On Windows you can choose between <a target="_new" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VMware
		Player</a> (free for non-commercial, personal and home use) or
		<a target="_new" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro/faqs.html#installation">VMWare Workstation Pro</a>
	</li>
	<li>On Linux the <a target="_new" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html">VM
		Workstation Player</a> can be obtained for use and evaluation.
	</li>
	<li>On macOS <a target="_new" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion</a> has a download for evaluation,
		but is a commercial product (after the evaluation period of 30 days, a license must be purchased to keep using it).
		Note that the versions we found to work are:
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/13.0.1/rn/vmware-fusion-1301-release-notes/index.html">Fusion 13.5.0</a>,
				the latest, supports macOS versions 12 Monterey and later (i.e. 14 Sonoma);
			</li>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/12.2.5/rn/vmware-fusion-1225release-notes/index.html">Fusion 12.2.5</a>,
				supports macOS versions 11 Big Sur and later (i.e. 12 Monterey and 13 Ventura).
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

If you identify issues with the recommended software or versions, please inform us.

<h4>Step 3: Obtain the Geant4 virtual machine</h4>
Obtain the Virtual machine file which corresponds to your player, and uncompress it:

<ul>
	<li>Download the Geant4 Virtual Machine. Note that the VM file is quite large (&gt;18 GBytes),
		and may take a long time to download (will depend greatly on your network bandwidth).
	</li>
	<li>The file to download is located at:
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://heberge.lp2ib.in2p3.fr/G4VM/Vmware/Stable/geant4.11.2.0">VMware VM - Geant4 11.2.0</a> (VMware on Intel chips)</li>
			<li><a target="_new" href="https://heberge.lp2ib.in2p3.fr/G4VM/Vmware/Stable/geant4.11.2.0/Mac">VMware VM - Geant4 11.2.0</a> (VMware on macOS Apple Silicon chips)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>We recommend to start to download it few days before the course, to ensure that you can obtain it, and to familiarize yourself with it.
		For more information about the Geant4 VM see <a target="_new" href="https://geant4.cenbg.in2p3.fr">CENBG home page</a>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4: Uncompressing and starting the Virtual Machine</h4>
You need software which can un-compress '7z' files. There are many other choices, such as the popular (de-)compressor
<a target="_new" href="https://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a>.
On macOS you may use the built-in Archive Utility.

Follow the instructions in the <a target="_new" href="https://heberge.lp2ib.in2p3.fr/G4VM/Vmware/Stable/geant4.11.2.0/readme-g4.11.2.0">readme</a>
file for launching the VM.

Note that you may encounter issues on opening the VM file:
<ul>
	<li>on PC, including Windows and some Linux systems, you will likely need to enable features needed for virtualisation in the BIOS.
		This is needed if you encounter a message such as "Intel Vtx is disabled...";
	</li>
	<li>on macOS you may need to grant access to some resources to Fusion -- this may require a reboot.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 5: Locate the Geant4 installation and check it</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The virtual machine will boot.</li>
	<li>You should now obtain a (Linux) desktop, which is mostly empty.
		<ul>
			<li>Its menus can be found in the top left corner (icon and 'Activities').</li>
			<li>It's keyboard is configured as French 'AZERTY'. You can change this to US 'QWERTY' layout by
				changing the keyboard settings using "Settings" from the menu on the top right corner.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Open a Terminal window using the icon "Activities":
		<ul>
			<li>Look for the rectangle with a silver border around a prompt (in this menu) and you use it to obtain a Terminal.</li>
			<li>You should see a new window, ready to accept your commands</li>
			<li>It is running the command shell 'tcsh'</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Locate Geant4.
		The Geant4 installation is located under this path:
		<br/><br/>
		<codeblock>
			$ echo $G4INSTALL<br/>
			/usr/local/geant4.11.2.0<br/>
			$ echo $G4EXAMPLES<br/>
			/usr/local/geant4.11.2.0/share/Geant4/examples<br/>
			$ ls $G4EXAMPLES<br/>
			advanced/ basic/ CMakeLists.txt extended/ .....<br/>
		</codeblock>
		<br/>

	</li>
</ul>
We thank CENBG and CNRS for providing the Geant4 Virtual Machine, which is described in the article
<a target="_new" href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793962310000122">Int. J.
	Model. Simul. Sci. Comput. 1 (2010) 157-178</a>, for updating it regularly and promptly with each
production release and patch, and for their helpful collaboration.<br/>
<br/><hr/><h2><a class="content" id=example>Compiling the first example</a></h2>


Every time you want to compile or run an application using Geant4,
<b>remember</b> to set up run-time environment variables.
<br/>
Use the appropriate script extension depending on your
shell type, .sh for bash family while .csh for tcsh family.<br/><br/>

Also <b>remember</b> <code>&lt;tutorial&gt;</code> is the working directory and <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code> is the directory where Geant4 is installed.<br/>
You must replace this string with the appropriate directory path in your disk space.<br/><br/>


<codeblock>
	$ source <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/install/bin/geant4.[c]sh<br/>
	$ printenv | grep GEANT4
</codeblock>
<br/><hr/>

<h3><a class="content" id="ex1a">Exercise 1</a></h3>

Compile Example basic B1 provided with Geant4.
Example code can be found at:

<code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/examples/basic/B1. <br/><br/>

This is an application that needs Geant4 libraries and headers to be compiled
correctly, thus you will need to instruct cmake to
use Geant4 from the location where it is installed.<br/><br/>

<codeblock>

	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt;
	$ mkdir HandsOn1<br/>
	$ cd HandsOn1<br/>
	$ cp -r <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/examples/basic/B1 .<br/>
	$ cd B1<br/>
	$ cmake .<br/>
	$ make -j <i>2</i> -f Makefile<br/>
	$ ls<br/>
	... some lines of output ...<br/>
</codeblock>
<br/>
<b>Note </b>: If you get the line: <code>[100%] Built target
	exampleB1</code> everything worked as expected.
<br/><br/>


<br/><hr/><h2><a class="content" id=play>Familiarizing with a Geant4 application</a></h2>

Start the application built in the previous exercise. For this very
first test, we disable Qt interface.<br/>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<codeblock>
	$ ./exampleB1

<b>Note</b>: G4 can be quite verbose, especially if you have enabled MT
support.
<br/>

If you receive error messages like <code>ERROR: G4VisCommandsViewerSet::SetNewValue: no current viewer</code> you can
safely ignore them.<br/><br/>


<h4>If you use Qt:</h4>

A GUI window should pop up.
<br/><br/>

<img src="gui.png" width="900"/><br/><br/>
You can type your command in the <code>Session:</code> field at the right-bottom of the window.
You may also pick a command from the left side menu. <br/>

Try 10 events and see trajectories.

<codeblock>
	/run/beamOn 10
</codeblock>

<br/>
