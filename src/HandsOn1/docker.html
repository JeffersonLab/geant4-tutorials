<a href="https://docs.docker.com"> Docker </a> is a tool designed to make it easier to run applications by using containers.
Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs,
such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.


Docker is available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. You can find the installation instructions
for your OS <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/">here</a>.<br/><br/>

We have a Docker image with Geant4 and all the necessary libraries installed.
You can pull the image from the Docker Hub by running the following command:<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ docker pull &lt;imagename&gt;
</codeblock>
<br/>
where <code>&lt;imagename&gt;</code> is the name of the image you want to pull:

<ul>
	<li>###DOCKERIMAGEFEDORA</li>
	<li>###DOCKERIMAGEUBUNTU</li>
</ul>

Once the image is pulled, you can run it in batch mode or interactively.<br/><br/>

<h4> Batch Mode:</h4>
<codeblock>
	$ docker run -it &lt;imagename&gt;
</codeblock>

<h4> Interactively:</h4>
