<h2><a class="content" id=play>Familiarizing with a Geant4 application</a></h2>

<h3><a id=ex2a>Exercise 2</a></h3>

Start the application built in the previous exercise. For this very
first test, we disable Qt interface.<br/>

<h4>Solution</h4>

<codeblock>
	$ ./exampleB1
</codeblock>

<br/>


Geant4 will initialize and will greet you with some output, the
first lines should read:<br/>

<pre>
###G4STARTLOG
</pre>

<br/>
<b>Note</b>: G4 can be quite verbose, especially if you have enabled MT
support.
<br/>

If you receive error messages like <code>ERROR: G4VisCommandsViewerSet::SetNewValue: no current viewer</code> you can
safely ignore them.<br/><br/>



<h4>If you use Qt</h4>

A GUI window should pop up.
<br/><br/>

<img src="gui.png" width="900"/><br/><br/>
You can type your command in the <code>Session:</code> field at the right-bottom of the window.
You may also pick a command from the left side menu. <br/>

Try 10 events and see trajectories.

<codeblock>
	/run/beamOn 10
</codeblock>

<br/>

<hr/>

<h4>If you do not use Qt but use OpenGL visualization</h4>


A visualization window will appear with the geometry displayed.<br/><br/>

<img src="vis.png" width="900"/><br/><br/>
You will see Geant4 prompt on your terminal screen, where you can issue Geant4 commands. <br/>
<br/>Try 10 events and see trajectories.


<codeblock>
	Idle&gt; /run/beamOn 10
</codeblock>




<br/><br/><hr/>

Refer to the presentations at this tutorial for UI interactivity.<br/>

Take your time to familiarize with the Geant4 prompt (for example note
that the prompt has auto-complete, the <i>tab</i> key; history, with
up-down arrow keys).<br/>

Try navigating the GUI help panel.<br/>
Familiarize with the help menu and its sub-menu levels. Can you
find where the <code>/run/beamOn</code> command is located? What is
the UI command to change the primary particle type?<br/>


<h3><a class="content" id=ex3a>Exercise 3</a></h3>

Compile a second exercise.
Browse the <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/examples/ directory and try
a few examples.<br/>

Compile/run them following the instructions of the previous exercises.<br/><br/>

<b>Note</b>: Move to an appropriate directory before copying the second example.<br/>

<b>Important:</b> some examples may require additional libraries (e.g. GDML), thus may not
compile in this setup.<br/>
