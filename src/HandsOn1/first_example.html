<h4>Setting the Environment</h4>

Every time you want to compile or run an application using Geant4,
<b>remember</b> to set up run-time environment variables.
<br/>
Use the appropriate script extension depending on your
shell type, geant4.sh for bash family while geant4.csh for tcsh family.<br/><br/>

Also <b>remember</b> <code>&lt;tutorial&gt;</code> is the working directory and <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code> is the directory where Geant4 is installed.<br/>
You must replace this string with the appropriate directory path in your disk space.<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ source <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/install/bin/geant4.[c]sh<br/>
	$ printenv | grep GEANT4
</codeblock>

<br/><br/>

<div class="info">
	<strong>Note:</strong> This is not needed when using docker,
	as the environment is already setup, and <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>
	is <code>$G4INSTALL/source</code>.
</div>

<h3><a class="content" id="ex1a">Exercise 1</a></h3>

Compile Example basic B1 provided with Geant4.
Example code can be found at:

<code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/examples/basic/B1. <br/><br/>

This is an application that needs Geant4 libraries and headers to be compiled
correctly, thus you will need to instruct cmake to
use Geant4 from the location where it is installed.<br/><br/>

<codeblock>

	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt;<br/>
	$ mkdir HandsOn1<br/>
	$ cd HandsOn1<br/>
	$ cp -r <code>&lt;geant4&gt;</code>/examples/basic/B1 .<br/>
	$ cd B1<br/>
	$ cmake .<br/>
	$ make -j <i>2</i> -f Makefile<br/>
	... some lines of output ...<br/>
</codeblock>
<br/>

<div class="success">
	If you get the line: <code>[100%] Built target
	exampleB1</code> everything worked as expected.
</div>
