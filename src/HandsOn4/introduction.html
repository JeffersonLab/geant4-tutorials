<br/><br/><br/><br/><h1>Hands on 4: First physics measurements</h1>

In this fourth hands-on you will learn:
<ul>
	<li>How to define a user run class to accumulate quantities from different
		events.
	</li>
	<li>How to process this information to make a simple physics
		measurement using <code>G4UserRunAction</code>.
	</li>
	<li>How to store physics results on output files with
		<code>g4analysis</code> for post-processing analysis.
	</li>
	<li>How to modify physics list using constructors.</li>
</ul>

	The problem code for this hands-on session
	can be downloaded <a href="../HandsOn4-problem.tar.gz">here</a>.<br/>
	For your reference, the complete solution
	is also available <a href="../HandsOn4-solution.tar.gz">here</a>.<br/>

Un-tar the code, configure it with <code>cmake</code>, build it, and run it:<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt; #change to your working directory<br/>
	$ tar xzf HandsOn4-problem.tar.gz<br/>
	$ cd HandsOn4-problem<br/>
	$ cmake .<br/>
	$ make -j 2 -f Makefile<br/>
	$ ./G4tut
</codeblock>

<div class="info">
	The code of this tutorial is a modified version of Geant4 example B5. You can review almost all concepts from this tutorial in the example that can be found under:
	&lt;geant4&gt;/examples/basic/B5.
</div>

<br/>

The geometry is the same as the completion of the previous hands on.<br/>
We will not modify the geometry anymore, but several sensitive
detectors and hits classes have been added to the setup. <br/><br/>

Take a moment to look at the classes whose filenames ends with strings
<code>SD</code> and <code>Hit</code>. In particular it
is important that you understand how the calorimeter hits work.

In exercise number 2 you will calculate a very simple physics quantity (a
partial shower shape) from the energy released in calorimeters.<br/><br/>

<div class="info">
	Geant4 does not provide/recommend specific utilities for the analysis operations
	because these are strongly detector-specific. <br/
	However we do provide a light-weight histogramming and ntuple facility.<br/>
	These are compatible
	with AIDA and ROOT output format and they do not require any library
	installed on the system. They can also dump output in tabular form
	in text files (CSV) to import data in (virtually) any analysis system
	(pylab, R, Octave, Excel, Matlab,Mathematica, ...). <br/>
	If you do not have an
	AIDA-compliant tool nor ROOT installed, will not be
	able to display histograms, but you will still be able to read data
	written in CSV format.
