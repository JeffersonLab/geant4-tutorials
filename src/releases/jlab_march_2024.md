# March 2024 Geant4 Tutorial

[25â€“29 Mar 2024 Jefferson Lab](https://indico.jlab.org/event/828/)


Jefferson Lab (Newport News, VA) is organizing a four day tutorial course based on 
Geant4 version 11.2. 
It will cover all the application domains including high energy and nuclear physics, 
astrophysics and space engineering, medical applications, and newly arising 
industrial applications.
 
The lectures will cover all aspects of the toolkit of Geant4 version 11.2 
from basic installation through advanced topics including multithreading 
and variance reduction options, and will be interspersed with hands-on 
sessions that build a progressively more complex application extensible 
to real use. The course should be of interest both to complete novices 
and to those who already have some basic familiarity with Geant4. 
Participants are expected to have a reasonable knowledge of C++ and 
Linux OS in addition to basic radiation physics.
 
The tutorial starts in the morning of March 25th, 2024 (Monday) and runs 
through the afternoon of March 28th, 2024 (Thursday) with additional 
discussion sessions on March 29th, 2024 (Friday) for selected topics. 
For those who are interested, a tour of the Jefferson Lab experiment 
facilities is conducted in the morning of March 29th.
 
The capacity is limited to 60 on a first-come-first-served basis. 
This tutorial is in-person only and no remote participation is offered. 
The registration fee is $85 that should be paid as a part of the 
registration process. The fee covers refreshments for Monday through Thursday.
