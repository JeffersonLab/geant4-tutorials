# March 2024 Geant4 Tutorial

[25â€“29 Mar 2024 Jefferson Lab](https://indico.jlab.org/event/828/)


A four day tutorial course based on Geant4 version 11.2. 

 
The lectures will cover all aspects of the toolkit of Geant4 version 11.2 
from basic installation through advanced topics including multithreading 
and variance reduction options, and will be interspersed with hands-on 
sessions that build a progressively more complex application extensible 
to real use. The course should be of interest both to complete novices 
and to those who already have some basic familiarity with Geant4. 
Participants are expected to have a reasonable knowledge of C++ and 
Linux OS in addition to basic radiation physics.
