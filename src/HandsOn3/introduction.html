<br/><br/><br/><br/><h1>Hands on 3: Build detector, retrieve simulation results</h1>
<p>
<h1><font color="#FF0000">Under Construction</font></h1>
</p>

In this third hands-on you will learn how to:
<ul>
  <li>Create a semi-realistic geometry</li>
  <li>Collect simulation output from sensitive detectors in hits</li>
  <li>Use the event user-action to dump event information from hits on screen</li>
</ul>

<br/><hr/><br/>

<div class="success">
	<strong>Material:</strong> <br/><br/>
	The problem code for this hands-on session
	can be downloaded <a href="../HandsOn3-problem.tar.gz">here</a>.<br/>
	For your reference, the complete solution
	is also available <a href="../HandsOn3-solution.tar.gz">here</a>.<br/>
	Copy the the tar ball to your local area.<br/><br/>
</div>

<br/><hr/><br/>

Un-tar the code, configure it with <code>cmake</code>, build it, and run it:<br/><br/>

<codeblock>
	$ cd &lt;tutorial&gt; #change to your working directory<br/>
	$ tar xzf HandsOn3-problem.tar.gz<br/>
	$ cd HandsOn3-problem<br/>
	$ cmake .<br/>
	$ make -j 2 -f Makefile<br/>
	$ ./G4tut
</codeblock>
<br/>

<div class="warning">
	<strong>Note:</strong> Ignore compiler warning messages. They will disappear once you complete the exercise.
</div>
<br/>
This geometry should be displayed:
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>

The geometry is same as Hands On 2, as we will start from here to build a two-arm spectrometer. <br/>
The first arm is already defined, and in the first exercise you will build
the second arm completed with a calorimeter.

<br/><br/>

The second arm can be rotated between runs and the magnetic-field value can also be changed at run time using
user defined UI commands.<br/>
At the end of this hands on the complete geometry will look like this:
<br/><br/>

<img src="final.png" width=###IMAGES_WIDTH/>
<br/><br/>

The complete setup will include:
<ul>
  <li>Each arm with 5 drift-chamber planes to measure the
  position of the passing particles (in green).</li>
  <li>Each arm with a hodoscope made of scintillator plates to
  measure the time-of-flight of the incoming particles (in red).</li>
  <li>A central magnetic system to deflect the charged particles
  (white cylinder).</li>
  <li><b>Exercise:</b> An electromagnetic calorimeter composed of CsI crystals
  (yellow in the picture).</li>
  <li><b>Exercise:</b> An hadronic <i>sampling</i> calorimeter composed of Lead as
  absorber and Scintillator as active material (blue).
  </li>
</ul>
