<br/><br/><br/><br/><h1>Hands on 3: Build detector, retrieve simulation results</h1>




<H2><a name=intro>Introduction</a></H2>
In this third hands-on you will learn how to:
<ul>
  <li>Create a semi-realistic geometry</li>
  <li>Collect simulation output from sensitive detectors in hits</li>
  <li>Use the event user-action to dump event information from hits on screen</li>
</ul>
The code for this hands-on session
is <a href="HandsOn3.tar.gz">here</a> (
for your reference, the complete solution
is also availavble <a
href="HandsOn3-solution.tar.gz">here</a>).
Copy the the tar ball to your local area.<br/><br/>
Follow the instructions of <a href="../HandsOn1/index.html">Hands On
1</a> to configure with <code>cmake</code> the code and build it. Try
out the application:<br/><br/>
<TABLE border=1><TBODY><TR><TD><code>
&nbsp; $ cd &lt;tutorial&gt;<br/>
&nbsp; $ tar xzf HandsOn3.tar.gz<br/>
&nbsp; $ cd HandsOn3<br/>
&nbsp; $ cmake .<br/>
&nbsp; $ make -j <i>2</i> -f Makefile<br/>
&nbsp; $ ./G4tut
</code></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><br/>
<font color="#ff0000">Note:</font> Ignore compiler warning messages. They disappear once you complete the exercise.<br/><br/>
This geometry should be displayed:<br/><br/>

The geometry is same as <a href="../HandsOn2/index.html">Hands On
2</a>, as we will start from here to build a two-arm spectrometer. The first arm
is already defined, and in the first exercise you will build
the second arm completed with a calorimeter:
<ul>
  <li>Each arm includes 5 drift-chamber planes to measure the
  position of the passing particles (in green).</li>
  <li>Each arm includes a hodoscope made of scintillator plates to
  measure the time-of-flight of the incoming particles (in red).</li>
  <li>A central magnetic system to deflect the charged particles
  (white cylinder).</li>
  <li><b>Exercise:</b> An electromagnetic calorimeter composed of CsI crystals
  (yellow in the picture).</li>
  <li><b>Exercise:</b> An hadronic <i>sampling</i> calorimeter composed of Lead as
  absorber and Scintillator as active material (blue).
  </li>
</ul>



The second arm can be rotated between runs. The
magnetic-field value can also be changed. User defined UI commands allow
to change arm rotation and magnetic field value at run time.<br/>
At the end of this hands on the complete geometry will look
like:<br/><br/>
