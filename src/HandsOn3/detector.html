</div><br/>

In this exercise we will cover basic aspects of retrieving
physics quantities from the simulation kernel.<br/><br/>

The basic simulation output is called
<code>hit</code> (a user-defined class derived from <code>G4VHit</code>).
Typically we are not interested in every step in entire detector volumes, but instead we want to
retrieve information only for the detector components we are interested in (e.g. the scintillator tiles
in the hadronic calorimeter, and not the lead absorber).
In Geant4 this is achieved with the concepts of <code>hits</code> and
<code>sensitive detectors</code> (SD): you can attach a SD (a user class
inheriting from <code>G4VSensitiveDetector</code>) to a logical
volume, in this way Geant4 will call your detector code when a particle is
making a step in this specific volume.

<br/><br/>

<div class="info">
	<strong>hit</strong> is a container of information you want to retrieve (e.g. energy deposit in space and time).
</div>

<br/><br/>

Information (e.g. energy deposited along the step) can be retrieved from the
<code>G4Step</code> and a new hit could be created (or an
existing hit is updated). <br/>

Geant4 will keep track of all hits created
in the application. These can be retrieved at the end of the event for further
post-processing and writing to output.<br/><br/>


We will show how to measure a quantity, for each event,
from the hodoscopes. The goal is to measure at what time and in which hodoscope
tile there was a hit.<br/>
The exercise is divided in three parts, and you will have to modify
four files:
<ul>
	<li><code>HodoscopeHit.hh</code> and <code>HodoscopeHit.cc</code> files
		implement the hit class for the hodoscope.
	</li>
	<li><code>HodoscopeSD.cc</code> implements the hodoscope sensitive
		detector.
	</li>
	<li><code>DetectorConstruction.cc</code> instantiates the sensitive detector
		and attaches it to the correct logical volume.
	</li>
</ul>


<br/><br/>

<h3>Exercise 2 Step 1</h3>

Create a concrete hit class.

<br/><br/>

In this exercise the concrete hit class represents a data container for only two
quantities:

<ul>
	<li>an integer value, representing the index of the hodoscope tile
		that is fired;
	</li>
	<li>a double value, representing the time in which the
		hodoscope tile is fired.
	</li>
</ul>


<div class="info">
	<strong>Reminder</strong>: a hodoscope is a simple set of
	scintillator fingers that measure the time in which a charged particle
	passes through it. It can be used to performed time-of-flight
	measurement and coarse-granularity position measurements.
</div>

<br/>


You will need to modify the <code>HodoscopeHit</code> class. The class skeleton is
already prepared, you should add two data members that identify which hodoscope
tile has fired and register the time of the hit.<br/><br/>


Implement/modify the <code>Print</code> method to dump
the hit content.<br/><br/>

<div class="warning">
	The operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> must be overwritten. <br/><br/>
	<strong>Note on <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code></strong>:<br/><br/>
	Frequest instantiation and deletion of objects can put some pressure on CPU. Allocating an objcet on the heap and releasing it are (relatively) CPU-intensive operations.<br/>
        In our case, for each event, many hits may be created
	and deleted at the end of each event. Thus the handling of hits may cause some
	performance degradation in a complex application.<br/>
	To mitigate this we use an ad-hoc <b><i>allocator</i></b> named <code>G4Allocator</code> that allows for an efficient re-use of memory and
	avoid many granular instantiations and deletions of objects of the same kind.<br/>
	The first time a hit is created, a memory <b><i>pool</i></b> is created that can hold
	many hits (like in an array). Each time a hit is created
	with this overwritten <code>new</code> operator we first look in this pool for an available
	<b><i>pre-allocated memory location</i></b>. If an empty slot is available, we
	re-use it, otherwise we expand the pool to accommodate more
	hits. Each time a hit is deleted with this overwritten <code>delete</code>, this memory space is not freed but kept for future re-use.<br/><br/>
	With this technique we reduce substantially the new/delete cycles needed
	for the simulation.<br/><br/>
	An additional complication is that in multi-threading
	environments special attention is needed for the use of allocators. 
	An object in a worker thread instantiated with this allocator must be deleted by the same thread. 
	The master thread (and other worker threads) may access such an object and get/set its contents, but cannot delete the object.<br/><br/>
	<code>G4Allocator</code> must be used for each individual concrete class. It must not be used for a base class from which
	several derived classes with different data members could be instantiated.
	We recognize this is a topic that requires some
	advanced knowledge of C++. But keep these code as they are so that you won't get bad surprise when you extend 
	the exercise code in the future.
</div>

<br/>


This exercise implements a single sensitive detector and one hit
type. In Hands On 4 additional
sensitive detectors are used with hits in the drift chambers and in
the calorimeters. You can study that code to see additional types
of hits (calorimeter hits are of some interest since <i>accumulate</i> energy
from several steps instead of creating a new hit at each step).

<h3>Exercise 2 Step 2</h3>

Create and manipulate hodoscope hits.

<br/><br/>

For this exercise you will modify the <code>HodoscopeSD.cc</code> file.
Some part of the code is already implemented, in particular the
initialization of the hits collection, use this code as a reference
for your future applications: it is important to understand the details of
how the registering of hits with the Geant4 kernel works.<br/>

<br/>

What you need to do for this exercise is to modify the method
<code>ProcessHits</code> and implement the logic to extract time and
position. This is the method that Geant4 kernel will call every time a
particle passes through the volume associated with this SD.


<br/>
We use information stored in the <code>G4Step</code> object: it encodes the information regarding the
simulated step in the geometry volume.<br/><br/>

<div class="info">
	<strong>Hint 1</strong>: <code>G4Step</code> has two 
	(<code>G4StepPoint</code>) objects that delimit the step (pre-step and post-step).
        Information of the volume should be taken from "pre-step point".<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>Hint 2</strong>: We are simulating a scintillator detector that will
	trigger only if some energy has been deposited (i.e. via ionization),
	for example if a neutron passes through the detector (without making
	interactions) its passage should not be recorded. Check the energy
	deposited in the step, if zero do nothing.<br/>
	<br/>
	<strong>Hint 3</strong>: More than one step can be done by the same particle in
	a single volume (why?), in addition secondaries produced in the volume
	will also make steps in the SD. This mean that for a given primary particle we
	can have more than one call to the <code>ProcessHits</code>.
	A realistic detector electronics will responds with a
	single measurement: to simulate this behavior every time a new step is
	processed we check if the hit for the hodoscope tile that fired already
	exists, if so we update the time information if the new hit happens
	earlier than the already recorded one.

<h4>Solution</h4>

	<div class="filename"> File: HodoscopeSD.cc</div>
	<br/>
	G4bool HodoscopeSD::ProcessHits(G4Step* step, G4TouchableHistory*)<br/>

<h3>Exercise 2 Step 3</h3>

Construct the SD and attach it to the correct logical volume.

<br/><br/>


We can now create an instance of the HodoscopeSD and attach it
to the correct logical volume. Add a separate instance of the SD to
each arm hodoscope.

<br/><br/>

Give the names <code>/hodoscope1</code> and <code>/hodoscope2</code> to
these SDs. The same class is used for two logical volumes, the
two instances are recognized by Geant4 only via their names.<br/><br/>


We are going to modify the method
<code>ConstructSDandField</code> in the DetectorCostruction class.
If you are already a user of older version of Geant4
(up to version 9.6) this is one of the new
main features introduced in version 10.0 to be compatible with multi-threading.
To reduce memory consumption geometry is
shared among threads, but sensitive-detectors are not.
